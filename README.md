# Fake job Detection: Investigating Fake job posts to avoid the job scam

## Project Overview

In this project, I predicted fake job postings from a dataset listed with real-world job posts. The dataset is hosted by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction), originally collected by The University of the Aegean | Laboratory of Information & Communication Systems Security. The dataset consists of 17,880 rows of job postings, and about 800 posts are fake. I use Machine Learning techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze job posts, build **Classification Models** that aim to predict fake jobs out of real ones, and evaluate them finding out **Topic Modelling**. I also perform various methods of data visualization and communication to convey findings and actionable insights.

The folders in this file are required:

1. ‘data_folder’ - this contains all .pkl files that are necessary to run the notebooks, you can download from this link https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1SNnWQBiwpCJjDusVaTR4hZ4_MeVp2sca

   down load, unzip and put all 3 child folders in the root directory.

2. requirement.txt

3. .ipynb files

4.  You also need 'lexvec-wikipedia-word-vectors' to run the notebook 5, you can download from this link.https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NtOjkNtbevgg5xWkcop62NYY332tmiJh/view

   put the downloaded file in folder word_vectors.
